        //Note that the keyword "let" creates a new variable then u name it and after the equals
        //you assign a value to it, this could be a string, int, float or boolean
        //Also you may not use reserved words for variable names, it will create errors
        //and you cannot start variable names with numbers either
        //special characters are also forbidden in variables except "_"(underscore) and "$"(dollar sign)

        //this is the first variable we created it is similar to rust where we use the "let" keyword
        //Note that JS has dynamic variables so there is no specific data type associated with it
        let var1 = 3;
        //this displays what is currently stored in var1 which is 3 since we assigned 3 to it above
        console.log(var1);

        //this calculates what has been entered which is added to 4 and displays it in the console
        let clac = 2+2;
        console.log(clac);

        //the below assigns the string to the variable and then displays it into the console
        let msg = "hello gooner";
        console.log(msg);

        //this changes the variable's value and when displayed will use the newest value assigned
        //Alert❗❗❗ see how we don't use "let", this is because the variable already exists
        //it will give an error if you try that nonsense🫵
        msg = "goodbye hoodlum";
        console.log(msg);

        //This is a constant and we can tell by the key word "const"
        //this means that it will never change cause I'm always gonna be Grandpabilly69❗❗☢️
        //Note only use let if you know u gonna change the value and const if u not
        //This is to save memory and processing power and u need that especially in JS
        //cause this language is slow and ineffiecent af👎👎😴😒
        const name = 'Grandpabilly69';


        //You can also create variables with the key word "var"
        //this is og way of doing creating variables but is
        //interchangeable with let
        //You get the power to choose even though you can't make decisions😒😑🥱
        //Some down sides of this is that we tend to not use var nowdays since its wack and all
        //but u better not goon all over me cause I dont make the rules
        var goonVar = 'u a goon';
