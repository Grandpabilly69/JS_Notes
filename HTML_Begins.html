        CSS is done inside them to change appearances of elements and edit them to your liking
        Note that we change all buttons backgrounds to red and the words inside white-->

        <!--The below creates a button and is named hello on the website

    The below is also an example of an element
    To create an element you must add the 2 arrows and the name of element in the middle
    as seen below
    The below button has a title which is a tool tip
    so if you hover over the button it will display whatever is in the double quotes that title is equal to

        Note that the above was previously just button so it changed all buttons
        to the style we selected, now we have only changing the buttons with the class attribute

    We then added a class attribute where any button that has the class red-button
    will get the CSS attributes from above-->
        <button title="tool tip" class="red-button"
                onclick="
                    alert('good job')
                    //above allows us to write JS code inside the quotes on onclick event
                    //this can be done with other events as well">
            hello
        </button>
        <!--The below creates a paragraph in the website
        whatever is inside the Ps will be displayed in a paragraph
        in the website
        You can also create an element inside other elements as seen below-->
        <p>
            paragraph of
            <button class="yellow-button">sheesh</button>
            text
        </p>
    <!--Note that new lines in HTML code does not correlate to the website it will be read as one space-->

    <!-- Note that the below is the script element that adds JS into the website-->
        <script>
            alert('hello');
            //console.log displays the content inside the parenthesis to the console of the website
            console.log(2+2);
        </script>
